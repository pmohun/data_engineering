    "## Building an IoT Analytics Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "The term Internet of Things (IoT) refers to the interconnection of physical devices with the global Internet. These devices are equipped with sensors and networking hardware, and each is globally identifiable. Taken together, these capabilities afford rich data about items in the physical world.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cloud IoT Core is a fully managed service that allows you to easily and securely connect, manage, and ingest data from millions of globally dispersed devices. The service connects IoT devices that use the standard Message Queue Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol to other Google Cloud Platform data services.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cloud IoT Core has two main components:\n",
    "- A device manager for registering devices with the service, so you can then monitor and configure them.\n",
    "- A protocol bridge that supports MQTT, which devices can use to connect to the Google Cloud Platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Objectives:\n",
    "- Connect and manage MQTT-based devices using Cloud IoT Core (we will use simulated devices.)\n",
    "- Ingest a stream of information from Cloud IoT Core using Cloud Pub/Sub.\n",
    "- Process the IoT data using Cloud Dataflow.\n",
    "- Analyze the IoT data using BigQuery.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### GCP Products:\n",
    "- BigQuery\n",
    "- Cloud Pub/Sub\n",
    "- Dataflow\n",
    "- IoT"

    "- Google Cloud IoT API\n",
    "- Google Cloud Pub/Sub API\n",
    "- Dataflow API\n",
    "\n",
    "2.) Create a Cloud Pub/Sub Topic\n",
    "- In the GCP Console, go to Navigation menu> Pub/Sub> Topics.\n",
    "- Click Create Topic. The Create a topic dialog shows you a partial URL path, consisting of projects/ followed by your project name and a trailing slash, then topics/ . Confirm that the project name is the one you noted above.\n",

    "- For Cloud Dataflow Regional Endpoint, choose the region closest to you.\n",
    "- For Cloud Pub/Sub input topic, enter projects/ followed by your GCP project ID then add /topics/iotlab . The resulting string will look like this: projects/qwiklabs-gcp-d2e509fed105b3ed/topics/iotlab\n",
    "- For BigQuery output table, enter your GCP project ID followed by :iotlab.sensordata. The resulting string will look like this: qwiklabs-gcp-d2e509fed105b3ed:iotlab.sensordata\n",
    "- For Temporary location, enter gs:// ollowed by your GCP project ID and then /tmp/. The resulting string will look like this: gs://qwiklabs-gcp-d2e509fed105b3ed/tmp\n",
