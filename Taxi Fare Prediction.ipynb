    "## Taxi Fare Prediction using BigQuery and ML\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "- BigQuery is Google's fully managed, NoOps, low cost analytics database. With BigQuery you can query terabytes and terabytes of data without having any infrastructure to manage, or needing a database administrator. BigQuery uses SQL and can take advantage of the pay-as-you-go model. BigQuery allows you to focus on analyzing data to find meaningful insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "- BigQuery Machine Learning (BQML, product in beta) is a new feature in BigQuery where data analysts can create, train, evaluate, and predict with machine learning models with minimal coding.\n",
    "\n",
    "- This notebook will explore millions of New York City yellow taxi cab trips available in a BigQuery Public Dataset. It will demonstrate how to create a machine learning model inside of BigQuery to predict the fare of the cab ride given model inputs. Lastly, it will evaluate the performance of the model and make predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Objectives:\n",
    "- Use BigQuery to find public datasets\n",
    "- Query and explore the public taxi cab dataset\n",
    "- Create a training and evaluation dataset to be used for batch prediction\n",
    "- Create a forecasting (linear regression) model in BQML\n",
    "- Evaluate the performance of your machine learning model"
